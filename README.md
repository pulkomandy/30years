Amstrad CPC 30 years megademo - Shinra part
===========================================

This is my part for the Amstrad CPC 30 years megademo. It is released for you to
see how it's done, and steal the ideas in there and improve on them.

The code is distributed under the MIT license. The graphics and music are not
completely mine, so if you want to reuse or distribute them, agreement from
all the authors is needed. I can help contacting some of them if needed.
